          The name [bytes] is a nod to the building blocks of everything we do
          as developers. We chose it because it captures what this platform is
          all about:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Small, digestible pieces of knowledge</li>
          <li>Real stories and lessons from developers like you</li>
          <li>Content that's quick to read but long on impact</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Whether you're sharing a one-line fix, a deep dive into a framework,
          or a career reflection, your post is a byte of your journey—and part
          of a growing ecosystem of dev wisdom.

          We believe that every small piece of knowledge—every byte—has the
          power to make a difference. This platform is designed to bring those
          bytes together into a vibrant, collective story of the developer
          experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our goal is simple: to provide a space where developers can share
          their unique insights, challenges, and breakthroughs in an accessible
          and meaningful way.
